/*
Unlike date_part() or EXTRACT(), date_trunc() keeps date/time units larger than the field you specify as part of the date. So instead of just extracting one component of a timestamp, date_trunc() returns the specified unit and all larger ones as well.

Recall the syntax:

date_trunc('field', timestamp)
